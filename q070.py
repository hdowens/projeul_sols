Explanation of code:

We know that when phi(n) is nearly n that n / phi(n) is going to be minimised.
When is phi(n) near n ? When there are as few small primes involved as possible, we need

(Remember phi(n) must be < n)

We know that phi(p) = p - 1 for each prime number p. It follows that p and p - 1 can never
be permutations of each other. Therefore, we need to find prime composites. 
phi(p1p2) = p1p2 * (1 - 1/p1)*(1-1/p2) = (p1 - 1)*(p2 - 1)

So for our answer n we have phi(n) = (p1 - 1)(p2 - 1). As stated before we need this to be
as close to n as possible to produce a minimum. If that is true, then we know that p1 and p2
must be close to sqrt(n) as we know at max p1 * p2 â‰ˆ n. So we only need to search primes up to 
sqrt(n).
